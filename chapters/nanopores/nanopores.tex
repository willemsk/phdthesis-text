\todo{types of nanopores}

Depending on their constituent material, nanopores are often classified into two distinct groups: the protein-based, \emph{biological} nanopores (\glspl{bnp}) and the semiconductor-based, \emph{solid-state} nanopores (\glspl{ssnp}).\cite{Dekker-2007} This division runs deeper than the material however, as BNPs are are formed in a bottom-up manner through self-assembly, while SSNPs are fabricated top-down using micromachining techniques. Perhaps the most crucial difference between the two classes is the extent to which they can be modified and manipulated. The proteiaceuous

In recent years, many different types of nanopores have been developed that do not necessarily fall within either category.

In 2009, Mueller \etal{} revealed the crystal structure of Cytolysin A (\gls{clya}) \cite{Mueller-2009}, a
large \textalpha-\gls{pft} secreted by various \textit{Salmonella enterica} and \textit{Esterischia coli}
strains with a high affinity for mammalian cell membranes. The large size of its \lumen---compared to
\gls{ahl} and \gls{mspa}, the most commonly used protein nanopores at the time---makes \gls{clya} particularly
well equipped to fully capture and study larger biopolymers, such as proteins, in their native
three-dimensional configuration (\ie~folded). In the following section, we will discuss the structure and
oligomerization mechanism of \gls{clya} in detail.

\subsubsection{Pore structure}

\paragraph{Pore shape and charge.}
%
The \SI{408}{\kDa} \gls{clya} pore (\pdbid{6mrt} \cite{Peng-2019}) consists of 12 idential subunits
(protomers), arranged in a ring like quaternary structure to form a cylindrical structure roughly \SI{14}{\nm}
in height and \SI{11}{\nm} in diameter (\cref{fig:clya_pore_side,fig:clya_pore_top}). The pore walls in
contact with the solvent are formed by a core bundle of four tightly packed \ta-helixes per protomer, and the
transmembrane region is formed by the iris-like arrangement of the amphiphatic N-terminal \ta-helices.
Virtually all helices contribute to interprotomer contacts, resulting in the burying of
\SI{\approx2400}{\square\angstrom} surface area, and the formation of 25~H-bonds and 13~salt bridges per
protomer-protomer interface. The interior shape of \gls{clya} can be described as a set of two hollow
cylinders placed on top of each other: a large \cisi{} chamber (`\lumen{}') with an inner diameter of
\SI{\approx5.5}{\nm} and a height of \SI{10}{\nm} and a smaller \transi{} chamber (`\textit{constriction}')
with a width of \SI{\approx3.6}{\nm} and a height of \SI{4}{\nm} (\cref{fig:clya_pore_section}). \Gls{clya}
has an excess negative charge (\SI{-60}{\ec} at \pH{7.5}), most of which riddle the interior walls of the
pore. This results in a negative electrostatic potential inside both the \lumen{} and the constriction of the
pore (\cref{fig:clya_pore_section}) and explains the observed cation selectivity
\cite{Soskine-2012,Franceschini-2016}.

\paragraph{Monomer vs. protomer.}
%
The water-soluble \gls{clya} monomer (\cref{fig:clya_monomer}) consists of predominantly \ta-helices, with the
core of the protein formed by a bundle of four long \ta-helices (\ta A, \ta B, \ta C and \ta F). Packed at the
top and bottom of this bundle are respectively the C-terminal helix (\ta G) and a hydrophobic \tb-hairpin
motif flanked by to short \ta-helices (\ta D and \ta E) \cite{Wallace-2000,Mueller-2009}. Comparing this
structure to that of the protomer (\cref{fig:clya_protomer}), reveals that while three of the core helices are
merely straightened and elongated (at the expense of the \tb-hairpin and the \ta A2, \ta D and \ta E helices),
the \ta A1 helix must move to the opposite side of the monomer, a distance of \SI{\approx14}{\nm} (!). The
mechanism that enables these large conformational changes is similar to that of a spring-loaded lock, which is
opened upon membrane binding.

\paragraph{Oligomerization stoichiometry.}
%
Next to the typical 12-subunit pore (dodecamer, `Type I'), \gls{clya} can also form 13-mers (tridecamers,
`Type II') and 14-mers (tetradecamers, `Type III') \cite{Soskine-2013,Peng-2019}, with constriction diameters
of \SIrange{3.3}{4.0}{\nm}, \SIrange{3.7}{4.4}{\nm} and \SIrange{4.2}{5.2}{\nm}, respectively. Aside from
their increased aperture size, the overal structure and assembly mechanism of these pores is identical to that
of the dodecamer, and hence the following discussion will be limited to the Type I pore. Interested readers
are referred to the work of Peng and coworkers \cite{Peng-2019}, who recently obtained high-resolution
structures of the Type II and III pores using \gls{cryo-em}.

\subsubsection{Pore formation mechanism}

\paragraph{Pore formation.}
%
Initial binding of \gls{clya} monomers to the membrane (\textit{via} both specific and non-specific
interactions) is mediated by the partially solvent-exposed, hydrophobic residues of the \tb-hairpin motif.
Using Gly180 and Gly201 as hinges, the \tb-hairpin swings outwards to insert itself into the lipid bilayer,
which removes a stabilizing aromatic residue (Phe190) from its hydrophobic pocket and unlatches a two-helix
spring-loaded mechanism. This results in 1) the straightening and extension of three of the core helices (\ta
B, \ta C and \ta F), and 2) a \SI{180}{\degree} swinging of the \ta A helix (relative to \ta B, \ta C and \ta
F). The amphiphatic \ta-A1 helix, which will form the \gls{tmd}, now rests on top of the membrane and is
connected to the rest of the protein via a helix-turn-helix motif, with Pro36 acting as a hinge. The
subsequent oligomerization of the membrane-bound monomers further packs and buckles the \ta A1 helices,
effectivily pushing them downwards and allowing them to `wedge' a hole into the lipid bilayer.

\paragraph{Oligomerization kinetics.}
%
Initial far-UV \gls{cd} measurements of the \gls{clya} oligomerization process in the presence of the mild,
non-ionic detergent \gls{ddm} suggested a two-step process, in which the soluble monomers (\ce{M}) undergo a
rapid transition ($t_{1/2} \approx \SI{80}{\second}$) to molten globule-like intermediate (\ce{I}), followed
by a slow assembly  ($t_{1/2} \approx \SI{1000}{\second}$) of the membrane-bound protomers (\ce{P})into the
full dodecameric pore (\ce{P_12}) \cite{Eifler-2006}. However, subsequent investigation of the oligomerization
kinetics \textit{via} \gls{rbc} hemolysis assays \cite{Vaidyanathan-2014} and single-molecule
\gls{fret} \cite{Benke-2015} revealed that the intermediate state is actually an off-pathway by-product that
slows down the pore formation \cite{Roderer-2017}
%

  P
}{eq:clya_protomer_formation}
%
Note that converting from \ce{M -> I} ($k_{\text{MI}}$) is $\approx17~\times$ faster than \ce{M -> P}
($k_{\text{MP}}$), resulting the initial accumulation of molten globule-like intermediates. On the long term,
however, most of the monomers will convert to protomers, as the reverse reaction in the monomer to protomer
transition \ce{P -> M} ($k_{\text{PM}}$) is $\approx36~\times$ slower compared to its forward reaction
\ce{M -> P} ($k_{\text{MP}}$).

After sufficient monomers have bound to the membrane, the increased probability of intermolecular collision
between protomers results in the formation of linear mixtures of oligomers ($\ce{P_{n/m}}$) by a process
called protomer elongation \cite{Roderer-2017}
%

  \hspace{0.5cm}(n + m < 12)
}{eq:clya_protomer_elongation}
%
Because virtually all $\ce{P_n}$ species contribute to this process, the effective protomer concentration does
not decrease, making it both rapid and efficient. Formation of the full pore occurs rapidly \textit{via} ring
closure when a pair of oligomers---with a total protomer count of 12---collide and associate

}{eq:clya_ring_closure}
%
Even though all $\ce{P_{1\ldots11}}$ species contribute to the formation of $\ce{P_12}$, the relatively high
abundance of $\ce{P_5}$, $\ce{P_6}$ and $\ce{P_7}$ dictate that \SI{>50}{\percent} of all full pores are
formed by these oligomers \cite{Benke-2015}.

Fragaceatoxin C (\gls{frac}) is an \ta-\gls{pft} belonging to the family of the actinoporins, and is produced
by the sea anemone \textit{Actinia fragacea}. Its X-ray structure was resolved in 2015 by Tanaka \etal{}
\cite{Tanaka-2015}, and suprisingly contained several co-crystalized sphingomyelin (\gls{sm}) lipids per
subunit. This indicates that \gls{frac} does not merely exhibit a high degree of specificity towards
\gls{sm}-containing membranes, these lipids comprise an essential structural element of the pore itself. In
the following section we will describe and discuss the structure and assembly mechanism of \gls{frac}.

\subsubsection{Pore structure}

\paragraph{Pore shape and charge.}
%
The full \SI{176}{\kDa} \Gls{frac} porin (\pdbid{4TSY} \cite{Tanaka-2015}) consists of eight identical protein
subunits and three \gls{sm} lipids per protomer, bound at highly specific locations
(\cref{fig:frac_pore_side,fig:frac_pore_top}). It is shaped as a funnel with a height of \SI{7}{\nm} and
\cisi{} and \transi{} outer diameters of \SIlist{11;3.5}{\nm}, respectively. The extracellular (\cisi) part of
the pore comprises the bulk of each protomer and is rich in \tb-sheets (\tb-core). The \gls{tmd} is formed by
the iris-like arrangement of the N-terminal \ta-helices of each subunit, which are long enough (\SI{3.5}{\nm})
to span the entire lipid bilayer. The protomer-protomer interface buries a surface area of
\SI{777}{\square\angstrom}, to which both the \tb-core and the \gls{tmd} \ta-helices contribute, and is
further stabilized by protein-lipid H-bonding \cite{Tanaka-2015}. Close inspection of the pore walls reveal
the presence of eight lateral fenestrations, one between each protomer, that expose the hydrophobic core of
the membrane to the aqueous solvent (\cref{fig:frac_pore_section}). These openings are at least partially
occluded by the co-crystallized \gls{sm} lipids, which as such contribute \emph{structurally} to the pore.
Even though the precise biological function of these fenestrations remains unclear, it is likely that they
contribute significantly to the toxicity of sea anemone venom by 1) facilitating the diffusion of its small
hydrophobic components directly into the core of the lipid bilayer, and 2) disrupting the leaflet composition
of the membrane by catalyzing the flip-flip movement of lipids \cite{Tanaka-2015}. The interior of \gls{frac}
is also funnel-shaped, with a \cisi{} diameter of \SI{6}{\nm} and a \trans{} diameter, which is also the
pore's narrowest constriction, of only \SI{1.6}{\nm}. Consistent with the observation of its cation
selectivity \cite{Garcia-Ortega-2011,Wloka-2016}, the interior walls of the pore are predominantly negatively
charged, particularly at the \transi{} constriction (\cref{fig:frac_pore_section}). The extracellular regions
of the pore near the lipid headgroups exhibit a strong positive potential however, which likely aides in the
initial adhesion of \gls{frac} to the membrane \cite{Tanaka-2015}.

\paragraph{Monomer vs. protomer.}
%
In the water-soluble \gls{frac} monomer (\pdbid{3VWI} \cite{Tanaka-2015}) the N-terminal region (residues
1--29; contains a short \tb-sheet, a 3$_10$ helix and an \ta-helix) is packed closely against the C-terminal
\tb-core (residues 30--179; contains 11 \tb-sheets in a \tb-sandwich fold and one \ta-helix) and held in place
by the interaction between Phe16 and a hydrophobic cavity in the \tb-core (\cref{fig:frac_monomer}). The
\tb-core remains virtually unchanged in the protomer structure (\pdbid{4TSY} \cite{Tanaka-2015}), while the
N-terminal domain forms a much longer \ta-helix that spans the entire lipid bilayer
(\cref{fig:frac_protomer}). In addition, three lipids (`L1', `L2' and `L3') are bound at specific locations to
the \tb-core. Of these, the L1 position can be considered to be of high affinity and specific only to
\gls{sm}, whereas L2 and L3 are of lower affinity and hence more promiscuous \cite{Tanaka-2015}. 

\paragraph{Oligomerization stoichiometry.}
%
The a lytically active \gls{frac} pore can be obtained as an 8-mer (octamer, `Type I'), 7-mer (heptamer `Type
II') and 6-mer (hexamer, `Type III') \cite{Huang-2019}, with constriction diameters of
\SIlist{1.6;1.1;0.84}{\nm}, respectively. A non-lytic 9-mer (nonamer) has also been crystalized (\pdbid{3LIM}
\cite{Mechaly-2011}), and lower oligomeric states also appear to be capable of forming pores
\cite{Rojka-2016}.

\subsubsection{Pore formation mechanism}

\paragraph{Pore formation.}
%
Upon initial attachment of the monomer to the membrane, the binding of a single \gls{sm} lipid to the L1
pocket induces dimerization \cite{Tanaka-2015}. The resulting small conformational change (at residues 14--17)
displaces Phe16 from its hydrophobic pocket in favor of Val60 and partially unfolds the N-terminal domain.
Because dimerization is only possible in the presence of \gls{sm}, this lipid acts as both a receptor and an
assembly co-factor that contributes to the final structure of the pore. Sequential addition of other dimeric
units \textit{via} random collisions---which can occur frequently in the small \gls{sm} lipid raft
domains---give rise to higher oligomeric complexes that further destabilize the N-terminal region. Given the
limited space avaible in the lumen of the final pore (\SI{\approx2}{\nm} diameter), it is likely that the
insertion of the N-terminal \ta-helix occurs in a non-concerted manner prior to full ring closure
\cite{Cosentino-2016}. It is also possible that a pre-pore structure is formed, similar to the non-lytic
\gls{frac} nonamer \cite{Mechaly-2011}, with the amphipatic N-termini pushing through the membrane in a
concerted fashion \cite{Tanaka-2015,Rojko-2016} much like the \gls{clya} porin. Evidence favors the first
mechanism however, given that a sole N-terminal helix of many actinoporins can exist at the lipid-water
interface in a so-called `protein-lipid pore' \cite{Cosentino-2016}.
