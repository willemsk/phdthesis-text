\chapter{Computational modeling of biological nanopores}\label{ch:modelling}

% paragraph taken and adapted from introduction of will2018
The computational approaches most widely used to study nanofluidic transport in ion channels or biological
nanopores comprise \emph{discrete} (particle) methods such as molecular dynamics
(MD)\cite{Lynden-Bell-1996,Allen-1999,Aksimentiev-2005,Luan-2008,Bhattacharya-2011,Zhang-2014,DiMarino-2015,Belkin-2016}
and Brownian dynamics
(BD),\cite{Schirmer-1999,Im-2002,Noskov-2004,Millar-2008,Egwolf-2010,DeBiase-2015,Pederson-2015} and
\emph{mean-field} (continuum) methods such as the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB)
equations\cite{Grochowski-2008,Baldessari-2008-1} and Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP)
equations,\cite{Eisenberg-1996,Gillespie-2002,Simakov-2010}. The latter can be coupled with the Navier-Stokes
(NS) equation to include the electroosmotic flow.\cite{Lu-2012,Pederson-2015} Due to their explicit atomic or
particle nature, MD and BD simulations are considered to yield the most accurate results. However, the large
computational cost of simulating a complete biological nanopore system (100K--1M atoms) for 100s of
nanoseconds still necessitates the use of supercomputers.\cite{Aksimentiev-2005,Bhattacharya-2011} The
PNP(-NS) equations, on the other hand, are of particular interest due to their low computational cost and
analytical tractability. The aim of the following chapter is two-fold: (1) to equip the reader with deeper
understanding of the different physical phenomena that contribute to molecular transport in nanopores, and
(2) to give the reader a non-exhaustive yet thorough overview of the approaches available to nanopore
researchers investigate these phenomena through computional modeling.
